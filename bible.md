# RADJAX-Student Bible

## 2026-07-09 - Dense Tome targets and sparse top-k loss

- Added a modular dense Tome target loader that validates Contract manifests,
  loads records, supports dense `.npy` shards, and exposes probability batches
  for training code.
- Added sparse top-k KL-style loss support for future compressed teacher target
  payloads while keeping current default tests NumPy-only.
- Configured pytest to include `src` on the import path so the suite runs from
  a fresh checkout without ad hoc environment variables.

## 2026-07-09 - P0.3 architecture charter

- Added the normative RADJAX design philosophy and development roadmap to repo
  docs so future work can be evaluated against the project compass.
- Added the Phase 0 architecture charter documenting dependency direction,
  plugin boundaries, runtime boundaries, target module layout, public product
  path, current implementation classification, and conflicts to resolve before
  further implementation.

## 2026-07-09 - P0.4 student split contract

- Added the Student split contract documenting RADJAX-Student's product
  boundary, expected inputs and outputs, happy path, non-goals, claims made,
  claims not made, upstream/downstream relationships, current-code
  classification, and Phase 1 entry criteria.
- Cleaned up Phase 0 Markdown formatting without changing normative content.
